    <h1>Blood Hunter: Order of Dragon Blood</h1><hr>
    <p style="background-color: darkgreen;">
      Chromatic dragons are the cause of much evil in the world, and this order of blood hunters binds themselves to those dragons by mixing the dragons' blood with their own to better counter these fearsome adversaries.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Draconic Infusion</h2>
    <p>You have been injected with blood from a certain type of chromatic dragon. The damage type that corresponds to the type of dragon you were infused with the essence of will be used in some of your subclass features. </p>

    <h2>Breath Weapon</h2>
    <p>When you join the Order of Dragon Blood at 3rd level, the dragon blood in your body grants you a breath weapon similar to that of the dragon  the blood is from. When you take the attack action, you can replace one attack with an exhalation of elemental energy touched with necrotic residue. All creatures in a 15 foot cone extending from you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your hemocraft save DC or take damage equal to 3 rolls of your hemocraft die of the type listed in your Draconic Infusion feature, or half as much on a successful save. If any targets are resistant or immune to that type of damage, the damage type counts as necrotic for that target unless that target is immune to necrotic damage. 
      You can use this feature two times and regain one expended use at the end of any short or long rest. </p>
    <h2>Draconic Might</h2>
    <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain a +1 bonus to Strength and Constitution checks and saving throws and Strength based attack rolls as the dragon blood courses through your veins and bolsters you. </p>
    <h2>Draconic Defenses</h2>
    <p>When you reach 7th level, you gain a measure of defense against draconic weapons. You gain resistance to the type of damage listed in your Drcaconic Infusion feature, and you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. When you gain the Hardened Soul feature, you gain immunity to the frightened condition. </p>
    <h2>Brand of Greed</h2>
    <p>At the 11th level, you gain the ability to punish a creature for it's greed. When a creature branded by your Brand of Castigation feature touches gold, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your Hemocraft save DC or take necrotic damage equal to 2 rolls of your hemocraft die. A creature can only take this damage once per turn. </p>
    <h2>Blood Curse of the Elements</h2>
  <p>When you reach 15th level, you can rip away a dragon's defenses against its element. You learn the <a href="Blood_Curses.html">Blood Curse of the Elements</a> for your Blood Maledict Feature and it doesn't count against the number of blood curses you can know. </p>
    <h2>Heightened Draconic Defenses</h2>
    <p>At 18th level, you have had so much experience fighting dragons that you have become inured to their favorite abilities. You gain immunity to the type of damage listed in your Draconic Infusion feature, and allies within 10 feet of you are immune to the frightened condition. If a creature tries to frighten you when none of your allies are within 10 feet of you, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Hemocraft save DC or be frightened for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success. </p>
