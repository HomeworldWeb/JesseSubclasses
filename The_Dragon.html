    <h1>Warlock: The Dragon</h1><hr>
    <p style="background-color: maroon;">
      Dragons are not immortal as other warlock patrons often are, but they are incredibly powerful and quite capable of gifting magic to less powerful beings. 
    </p><br>
    <h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
    <p>At first level, the Dragon lets you choose from additional spells when you learn a warlock spell. Your additional choices depend on the exact type of Dragon your patron is as well as whether it is chromatic, metallic, gem, or something else. </p>

    <h2>Breath Weapon</h2>
    <p>Your dragon patron has gifted you a breath weapon that matches the type of Dragon your patron is, and must be a Dragon listed in the table below. It does 2d6 + your Charisma modifier damage unless specified otherwise of the type of damage listed in the shape listed. A target takes half damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, the DC of which equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier; the type of saving throw is determined by the table below. You can use it as an action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining any expended uses when you finish a long rest. This damage increases by 1d6 each time you reach another level in this class that grants you a subclass feature. </p>

    <p>*The targets must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the DC formula above, or for 1 minute, the target canâ€™t take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>1-4:</th>
        <td>The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>5-6:</th>
        <td>the target can not move or take actions of any kind. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. </p>
    <h2>Draconic Majesty</h2>
    <p>You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion. If you already have proficiency in at least two of those skills, you may also choose from the skill proficiency choices for the warlock class. </p>
    <h2>Fearsome Projection</h2>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can use the terrifiying image of your patron to scare your opponents. As a bonus action, you can choose any number of creatures within 45 feet of you that can see you and that you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, the creature sees a Gargantuan transparent image of your patron behind you and is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use this feature once and regain all expended uses at the end of a short or long rest. </p>
    <h2>Draconic Resistance</h2>
    <p>Also starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to the type of damage your Breath Weapon feature does. If your patron is a faerie dragon, you instead gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed. 
    <h2>Draconic Immunity</h2>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, you can use a reaction in response to you or a creature within 10 feet of you being targeted by an attack that does the same type of damage as you Breath Weapon feature, or if your patron is a faerie dragon, an effect that would charm you or a creature within 10 feet of you. This reaction grants immunity to the triggering attack or effect to you and all creatures within 10 feet of you. </p>
    <h2>Power of the Hoard</h2>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, you can channel your riches to empower yours strikes. Whenever you hit with a weapon or spell attack, once per turn, you can do extra damage depending on how much money you have on your person. Divide the number of gold pieces you have (platinum pieces count as 10 each, electrum count as 0.5 each, etc.), rounding down. With 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sided dice, roll the one with the greatest number of sides that is less than or equal to the value previously determined. The attack does that much extra radiant damage. </p>
