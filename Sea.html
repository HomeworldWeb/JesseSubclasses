    <h1>Druid: Circle of the Sea</h1><hr>
    <p style="background-color: turquoise;">
      The Circle of the Sea was originally only known to sea elves and tritons, but has since spread onto the coasts. Druids of this circle often live almost entirely underwater, and dedicate themselves to combatting underwater threats, such as sahuagin, merrow, and greater powers like aboleths and krakens.

    <h2>Aquatic Abilities</h2>
    <p>Your connection to the sea grants you a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breath underwater. If you already have a swimming speed, it is increased by 15 feet. Also, you can use you Wild Shape to transform into a creature with a swimming speed even before 4th level. </p>
    <h2>Soothing Waves</h2>
    <p>When you join the Circle of the Sea at 2nd level, whenever you and other creatures spend hit dice to heal during a rest while being within 300 feet of the ocean, you can enhance the soothing power of the ocean to allow each creature within 60 feet of you of your choice to add your Wisdom modifier to the amount healed by each hit die it spent. </p>
    <h2>Up from the Depths</h2>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, when you summon Beasts that have a walking speed of zero and do have a swimming speed, you can choose to give all of them a flying (hover) speed equal to each one's swimming speed. Also, you can communicate simple ideas to beasts that have swimming speeds. If you already have this second ability, you are now always under the effect of the spell Speak with Animals, but it only works with Beasts that have natural swimming speeds. </p>
    <h2>Current Direction</h2>
    <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to steadily make water flow, to assist or hamper a creatures ability to swim. As an action, you can choose an amount of water that woud fit in a 10 foot cube. Each creature in that water that is still in water at the end of its move action on its next turn is moved up to 20 feet in a direction you choose. If a creature does not take a move actio on its next turn, it is moved at the end of its turn. Each creature must be moved the same distance in the same direction. The side of the cube and the maximum distance moved both increase by 5 feet when you reach level 14 in this class. </p>
    <h2>Tidal Force</h2>
    <p>At the 14th level, you gain the ability to bring the force of the ocean against a creature you attack. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can force the creature to move 15 feet away from you and make a Strength saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature falls prone in its new space. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain up to 2 expended uses at the end of a short rest, and all expended uses at the end of a long rest.
