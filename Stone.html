    <h1>Druid: Circle of Stone</h1><hr>
    <p style="background-color: red;">
      Druids who join the circle of stone appreciate the abiotic components of nature as much as the living parts, and that the former outlasts the latter. 
    </p><br>
    <h2>Circle Spells</h2>
    <p>Your connection to the earth grants you additional spells at 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level. Once you have access to these spells, you always have them prepared, they count as druid spells for you, and they don't count against the number of druid spells you can have prepared each day. </p>

    <h2>Stony Form</h2>
    <p>When you join the Circle of Stone at 2nd level, when you use your wild shape, you can instead enter a stony form. In this form, you gain the following benifets:<br>&nbsp -Your AC is equal to either 17, or 14 + your Dexterity modifier (your choice each time).<br>&nbsp -Your Strength equals 16, if it is not higher already.<br>&nbsp -You gain resitance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. </p>
    <h2>Embedded Gems</h2>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, when you enter your stony form, powerful gems appear in it. Whenever you enter your stony form, roll 1d3, the number rolled equaling the number of gems that appear. For each gem, roll a d6, which determines the type of each gem, as according to the table below. Roll a d8 instead once you reach level 10 in this class, and a d10 when you reach level 14 in this class. While in your stony form, you may use an action to activate one of the gems, and the effect listed in the table takes affect. Once the gem is used, it disappears. Any gems that you haven't used when you exit the form do not carry over to the next time you enter it. </p>

    <h2>Sturdy</h2>
    <p>When you reach 10th level, your ties to the earth magically enhance you. You gain advantage against saving throws against being knocked prone, and an additional +2 bonus if you are touching earth or stone with your bare skin. Also, if you are at your maximum hit points and damage from an attack would reduce you to 0 hit points, you are instead left with 1 Hit Point. </p>
    <h2>One with the Earth</h2>
    <p>At the 14th level, you gain the ability to manipulate earth with your thoughts and motions. You can cast the following spells without expending a spell slot and with only somatic components: Earth Tremor(1st level), Meld into Stone(2nd level), Erupting Earth(3rd level), Stone Shape(4th), Wall of Stone(5th), Bones of the Earth(6th), Move Earth(6th). When you cast one of these spells in this way, you must succeed on a Wisdom check, the DC of which equals 10 + the spells level, or the spell fails and the action is wasted. This feature also gives you tremorsense out to 60 feet.
