      Monks of the Way of Control practice exerting the finest control over their bodies and minds.

    <h2>Fine-Tuned Reflexes</h2>
    <p>When you start to follow the Way of Control at 3rd level, you have impecable reflexes due to your understanding of how your body and other things move. You can add your Wisdom modifier to your Dexterity saving throws. 
      <h2>Accurate Blows</h2>
    <p>At 6th level, you can trade speed for accuracy when you use your flurry of blows. You may choose to use your flurry of blows before the first attack, as long as that attack is also an unarmed strike. If you do so, you make only one additional attack, but both attack rolls have advantage. </p>
    <h2>Tempered Mind</h2>
    <p>When you reach 11th level, you gain a measure of additional control over your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. </p>
    <h2>Undodgable Strike</h2>
    <p>Starting at 17th level, you can channel your ki to make an attack that is completely undodgable. When you make an unarmed strike, and before you make the attack roll, you can decide to spend 2 ki points to have the attack automatically hit. If you use this feature when you would have had disadvantage on the attack roll, it costs 4 ki points instead. Your Wisdom modifier is added to the damage of this attack. You cannot use this feature more than once in two turns. </p>
