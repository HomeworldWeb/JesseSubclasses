    <p>When you commit yourself to this way at 3rd level, you gain access to divination spells that you use to help track down those with great destinies, and abjuration to protect them.</p>
    <h3>Cantrips</h3>
    <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice, and you learn an additional one at 10th level. These cantrips must be in the divination or abjuration schools of magic, and any from the abjuration school must not have a range of self. </p>
    <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
    <p>The Cosmic Puzzle Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your divination and abjuration spells of 1st level and higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </p>
    <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
    <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice, although they have to be either divination or abjuration spells, and any abjuration spells cannot have a range of self. <br>The Spells Known column of the Cosmic Puzzle Spellcasting table shows when you learn learn more spells, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and meet the requirements for the spells you learn at 3rd level, except for the spells you learn at 4th, 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, which can be evocation spells. <br>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know from this trait with another spell of your choice, provided you only replace divination and abjuration spells with other spells from those schools, and do not learn abjuration spells with a range of self, and you only replace evocation spells with other evocation spells. </p>
    <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
    <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for spells you learned through this trait, and you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you learned through this trait you cast and when making an attack roll with one. <br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Spell save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier <br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Spell attack modifier</span> = your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier </p>
    <h2>Matching peices</h2>
    <p>Also at 3rd level, when you see that two peices of the cosmic puzzle have fitted together, you can strengthen their bond. When you see a creature using the help action (including if used as a bonus action) on another creature you can see and both are within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to spend 1 ki point to add your wisdom modifier to the "helped" ability check. </p>
    <h2>Telepathic Warding</h2>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can mentally shield those who aren't ready to defend themselves. When you and other creatures that you can sense within 30 feet of you make the same Inteligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw because of the same reason at the same time, after everyone makes their saving throws but before the effect of the results occur, you may spend 1 ki point to chose up to 3 + your Charisma modifier creatures (minimum maximum 3) whose saving throws were lower than your own and have them use your saving throw instead of their own. You may also spend 2 additional ki points to make the saving throw again and use the higher saving throw for yourself and the chosen creatures. </p>
    <h2>Shard of Destiny</h2>
    <p>Once you reach the 11th level, you gain the ability to reach into the future and bestow a peice of future prowess to yourself or one of your comrades. As an action, you may spend 5 ki points and choose one willing creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Depending on the creature you choose, a different effect occurs, as listed below: <br> &nbsp; -If you choose a creature aside from yourself who has a class, they may choose a class(or subclass)feature or feature improvement they would normally gain at a class level no more then 3 higher than their current level in that class. If the chosen feature is a subclass, the creature chooses one and gains any features gained upon choosing that subclass. <br> &nbsp; -If you choose yourself or a creature that does not have a class, the chosen creature improves their ability scores by a total of 4, either increasing two ability scores by 2, one by 2 and two by 1, or four by 1. After making these adjustments, recalculate any atributes based on the modified ability scores such as Armor Class or Hit Points, adjusting current Hit Points by the same amount as maximum Hit Points. <br>These effects last for 4 turns. You can use this feature up to three times and regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest, but you still cannot use it if you have less than 5 ki points remaining. 
    <h2>Shard of Destiny Improvement</h2>
    <p>By the 17th level, your ability to reach into the future has improved, and the effects of your Shard of Destiny feature improve in the following ways for each effect: <br> &nbsp; -The chosen creature may instead chose a class (or subclass) feature they would normally gain in up to 6 levels, although not subclass features aside from features gained upon entry of a subclass the creature does not yet have. Also, the chosen creature may instead improve ability scores as if they didn't have a class and were chosen, using the improvements described below. <br> &nbsp; -The chosen creature's ability scores can now be increased by a total of 6, but still no more than 2 per ability score. <br>These effects now last for 5 turns. </p>
