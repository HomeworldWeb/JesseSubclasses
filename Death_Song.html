    <h1>Bard: College of Death Song</h1><hr>
    <p style="background-color: darkorchid;">
      These unerving bards play songs for the dead, or songs of the dead for the living which is sometimes even worse.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Grim Inspiration</h2>
    <p>When you join the College of Death Song at 3rd level, you can infuse the inspiration you provide with necromantic power. When you give a creature Bardic Inspiration die you can activate this feature to provide the following effects when the die is used. A creature under the effect of such a Bardic Inspiration die fainly radiates darkness. <br><br> Ability Check: If the check is 13 or higher, you may choose up to three creatures you can sense within 30 feet of the creature that made the check to take necrotic damage equal to a roll of a die that has 4 fewer sides than the Bardic Inspiration die, + your Charisma modifier. <br>
    Attack: If the attack hits and leaves the target with 20% or less of it's maximum hit points, it takes additional necrotic damage equal to 2 rolls of the Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. <br>
    Saving Throw: If the saving throw was successful and the creature was forced to make the saving throw directly because of another creature (not including having to make a Dexterity saving throw to dodge an arrow, even though it was shot by another creature, for example), the creature that forced the saving throw takes necrotic damage equal to 1 roll of the Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier, and another roll of the die if it was an Inteligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. </p>
    <h2>Expanded Spells</h2>
    <p>Also at 3rd level, you can choose arcane spells that are in the necromancy school of magic when you are preparing your spells. </p>
    <h2>Music of Passing</h2>
    <p>At 6rd level, your music can save those close to death, or ease their passing. If you are within 15 feet of a creature you can see that has 0 hit points and is unconsious but not dead, you may use an action to make a Charisma check and a Dexterity check, add them, and if the total is 20 or greater you may either bring the creature to 1 hit point or to kill them instantly. </p>
    <h2>Peace to Undead</h2>
    <p>When you reach 10th level, your music can let the undead finally rest. You can use an action to force all undead within 30 feet that can hear you to make a Charisma saving throw, the DC of which equals 18 - twice it's challenge rating, rounding to the nearest whole number and down to 14 if 14.5. A undead can fail on purpose if it or a creature controlling it wants, but not against the will of the creature controlling it. If it fails, it immediately dies. </p>
    <h2>Deathly Inspiration</h2>
    <p>At the 14th level, you gain the ability to siphon the energy of souls leaving their body into the music you play. When a creature that is not a construct, elemental, fiend, ooze, plant, or undead dies within 30 feet of you, your Bardic Inspiration die is considered a d20 for 30 minutes. When 30 minutes have past without another one of the specified types of creatures dying within 30 feet of you, all of the bardic Inspiration dice you have given to other people revert to the normally appropiate type of die. If a d20 from this feature is used for an ability check that totals 13 or higher in conjunction with Grim Inspiration, use a d12 for damage.
