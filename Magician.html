    <h1>Bard: College of Magicians</h1><hr>
    <p style="background-color: gold;">
      Some bards hone their arcane abilities instead of musical and use them in their performances. 
    </p><br>
    <h2>Magician's Magic</h2>
    <p>When you join the College of Magicians at 3rd level, your arcane training grants the following benefits: <br> &nbsp; -The spells you can prepare are no longer restricted by school of magic. <br> &nbsp; -You can use a deck of playing cards, a top hat, a cane or a non-magical wand as a spellcasting focus. </p>
    <h2>Summon Animals</h2>
    <p>Also when you join the college, you learn one of the most popular tricks: Summoning small, cute animals. You can use an action to make a Charisma check and divide it by 4 rounding down. Up to the resulting number of Tiny beasts of the same type appear in unocupied spaces of your choice within 10 feet of you, but they count as fey instead of beasts. They disappear after 4 + your Charisma modifier minutes or if you dismiss them earlier. You can use this ability up to 2 times, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
    <h2>Diverting Attention</h2>
    <p>When you reach 6th level, you master the ability to discract your audience from what you are actually doing. When you cast a spell, you may make a Dexterity(Sleight of Hand) check with advantage contested by any creatures that can see you's Wisdom(Perception) checks with disadvantage. A creature that knows that you have this ability can either make the check with advantage or not make it at all. If the spell requires an attack roll, you have advantage on that roll against any creature that failed the contest. If the spell requires creatures to make a saving throw, any creatures that failed the contest have disadvantage on the saving throw. </p>
    <h2>Magician Adept</h2>
    <p>At the 14th level, your magic becomes such a part of you that you can use small amounts of it innately. For an action, you may do one of the following things:<br> &nbsp; -You or one willing creature that you can see within 30 feet of you teleports to an unocupied space that you can see within 15 feet of the starting location and within 40 feet of you. <br> &nbsp; -You cast the spell firebolt, which does 3d10 damage until you reach level 17(as a character, not in any particular class), at which point it's damage increases to 4d10. <br> &nbsp; -You cast the spell magic missile, which does not use a spell slot if cast at first level and does 1d6 + 1 force damage per missile. <br> &nbsp; -You use the Summon Animals feature (without expending a use of that feature). <br> You may use this ability up to 3 times and regain all expended uses when you finish either a short or long rest. </p>
