    <h2>Blood Curse of the Elements</h2>
    <p>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of Dragon Blood</p>
    <p>As an action, you can cause one creature of your choice that you can see within 80 feet of you to lose any resistance or immunity to the type of damage list in your Draconic Infusion feature for 1 minute. Additionally, the first time it takes damage of that type, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d8 extra damage of that type, or half as much on a succesful save. </p>
    <p>Ampify. If the cursed target succeeds on the saving throw, it must make the save again the next time it takes damage of that type. </p>
